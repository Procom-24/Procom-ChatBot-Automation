# Procom-ChatBot-Automation

Greetings! I hope you are doing well. Let's dive right in without delay.

### Previous Version 📁
This folder contains all old files and data utilized in the first iteration of Procom 
chatbot model. This model doesn't employ the RAG (Retrieve, Answer, Generate) paradigm. 
In this iteration of the Procom chatbot, our approach involved analyzing user queries 
using patterns and providing appropriate responses accordingly.

### Document Vectorization 📁
This folder contains all new files and data utilized in the second iteration of Procom 
chatbot model. It's the most recent iteration of Procom chatbot, and it is based on
the RAG (Retrieve, Answer, Generate) paradigm. 

Within this directory, you'll find files related to various competitions (PDFs, and DOCs), 
along with scripts and requirements files. We've attempted to create a RAG-based chatbot by 
integrating the Chroma database (a vector database) and OpenAI.

A note about the script, it parses all competition details files to create a vector database. 
Additionally, this sxript also contains code to execute and retrieve responses from user queries 
using the vector database. All steps are mentioned in the script so why don't you give it a try 😊.
